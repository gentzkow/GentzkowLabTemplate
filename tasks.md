# Practice Tasks

This section contains all the practice tasks designed to help you master the Gentzkow Lab workflow. Each task builds upon the previous one, so we recommend completing them in order.

## Task Overview

1. **[Task 1: GentzkowLabTemplate](task1.md)** - Learn the basics of the lab template and workflow
2. **[Task 2: Sherlock Extension](task2.md)** - Work with high-performance computing clusters  
3. **[Task 3: Python-based Archived Template](task3.md)** - Explore the legacy Python template

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tasks, make sure you have:

- Read the [Lab Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/15urblzRR2XaymiXhvlEVfCJCwuMQQ3KaF-l4ol68dnA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9zo0bcd06n82)
- Reviewed the [GentzkowLabTemplate wiki](https://github.com/gentzkow/GentzkowLabTemplate/wiki)
- Set up your computer according to the [setup instructions](setup_instr.md)
- Installed [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Familiarized yourself with Git and GitHub concepts

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues during any task:

1. Check the [Lab Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/15urblzRR2XaymiXhvlEVfCJCwuMQQ3KaF-l4ol68dnA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9zo0bcd06n82) for detailed procedures
2. Review the specific task instructions carefully
3. Reach out to your practice task assigner for guidance 

*Note: AI tools can be very helpful for coding, debugging, and learning new concepts. The lab sponsors ChatGPT Plus subscriptions for research assistants. Don't hesitate to use AI assistance when working through these tasks - it can help you understand complex concepts, debug code issues, and learn best practices more efficiently. Stanford also provides free access to the [AI Playground](https://uit.stanford.edu/aiplayground), a platform that allows you to use various AI models from vendors like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic in one spot.*
