# PowerPoint to PDF Conversion

## Summary

This extension includes the functionality to convert a PowerPoint (.pptx) into a PDF (.pdf) using Apple Script.

## How to Use

To enable this functionality, you must go to the `3_slides/make.sh` file and uncomment out line 37. The expected behavior is that all PowerPoint files in the `3_slides/source` directory will be converted into PDFs and stored in `3_slides/output`.

## Potential Warning

You may be asked to grant file access when running the program through a pop-up window.
