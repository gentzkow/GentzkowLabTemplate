# Each line of instruction in this `inputs.txt` file should contain a path to a source
# Lines beginning with # are ignored.
# Note that there should not be any leading or trailing spaces in the paths.
# Paths may be absolute or relative to the current module. For example, this is a relative path:
# ../examples/inputs_for_examples/mpg.csv
# And this is an absolute path:
# Users/username/GentzkowLabTemplate/examples/inputs_for_examples/mpg.csv
